 * The snap fetches this from the Hive Mind API (`GET /atoms/publisher-whitelist`)

 * accounts' hard `reported for` claims surface globally at sign-time (safety
 * overrides reputation, see docs/claim-surface-spec.md §5). When the API is
 * unreachable the snap falls back to an empty whitelist — only trust-circle
 * authored reports surface in that degraded mode.
